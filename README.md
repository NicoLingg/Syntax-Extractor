## ðŸŒˆ Future of Syntax Extractor
As the journey of Syntax Extractor continues, thereâ€™s a fascinating future awaiting. One of the primary focus is to enhance code interaction by identifying recurring patterns and codewords within the codebase. This initiative is driven by the ideology of compact representation and maintaining context with lesser text. Here are some of the envisioned advancements:

#### Code Abbreviation:
Imagine a scenario where common code declarations such as public static void are abbreviated to psv. While it may not seem much for a single instance, a codebase with repetitive instances can significantly benefit from such abbreviations:

plaintext
Copy code
psv, psv, psv, psv, psv

This is just a tip of the iceberg. The essence is to find such abbreviations that retain the code's context while reducing the text bulk.

#### Focusing on Input and Output:
Often, the primary interest lies in the Input and Output of our functions when querying, while the logic within the functions may not be as relevant for maintaining context. By concentrating on Input and Output, itâ€™s plausible to reduce a substantial amount of code text, possibly shrinking large codebases by up to 90% without losing the context.

#### Utilizing Tokenization:
The plan also includes employing tokenization tools like OpenAI's [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to measure and adapt these compression algorithms to various situations. This approach could further refine the process of code abbreviation and context retention.

#### Adaptive Compression:
The ultimate goal is to develop adaptive compression algorithms tailored to different scenarios. These algorithms could dynamically abbreviate and focus on essential parts of the code based on the context and requirements, making Syntax Extractor an even more dynamic and token-aware tool that can adapt to various programming paradigms and project specifications.
